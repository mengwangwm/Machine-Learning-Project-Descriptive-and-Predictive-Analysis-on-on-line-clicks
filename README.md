# Machine-Learning-Project-Descriptive-and-Predictive-Analysis-on-on-line-clicks

• Conducted exploratory data analysis and predictive analysis on on-line clicks data with 45 million observations and 24 anonymized variables, increasing the prediction performance with a log-loss value of 0.418
• Drove and Collaborated with whole team to implement Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and manual feature engineering technique to clean and transform the training dataset based on the unique properties of parameters
• Conducted Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Lasso, Random Forest, Boosting and Ensemble methods, and selected the Ensemble method by comparing models’ in-sample performances, then performed Ensemble on test data with a Kaggle score of 0.4226.
