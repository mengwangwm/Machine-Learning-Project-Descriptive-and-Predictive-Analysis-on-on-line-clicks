# Machine-Learning-Project-Descriptive-and-Predictive-Analysis-on-on-line-clicks
The goal of the project is to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze predicting clicks for on-line advertisements.

The goal of the project is to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze predicting clicks for on-line advertisements. We analyze data which little over 45 million observations and 24 different variables to make our predictions. Our outcome variable is a binary categorical variable, 1 representing an ad was clicked on and 0 being an ad was not clicked on. We go through a rigorous process of model building and parameter selection of the best fit model and the performance criterion used to evaluate the performance is the log loss function.


• Conducted exploratory data analysis and predictive analysis on on-line clicks data with 45 million observations and 24 anonymized variables, increasing the prediction performance with a log-loss value of 0.418
• Drove and Collaborated with whole team to implement Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and manual feature engineering technique to clean and transform the training dataset based on the unique properties of parameters
• Conducted Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Lasso, Random Forest, Boosting and Ensemble methods, and selected the Ensemble method by comparing models’ in-sample performances, then performed Ensemble on test data with a Kaggle score of 0.4226.
